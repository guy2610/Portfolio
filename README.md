# Portfolio of University Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository showcasing the projects and assignments I completed during my university studies.

This collection reflects my practical experience in programming, systems, security, and software design. The projects are organized by programming language, and each project folder includes source code, documentation, and where relevant, the course and grade.

## Technologies & Topics Covered

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Java, Python, SQL
- **Domains:** Operating systems, systems programming, defensive programming, object-oriented design, databases, cryptography, and cybersecurity

---

## Repository Structure

- **C/**  
  Projects written in C language, primarily focusing on low-level programming. Includes:
  - System call implementations
  - Linux namespaces (PID, mount)
  - Preprocessor simulations
  - Simple assembler
  - Bit-level operations  
  These projects demonstrate a deep understanding of memory, processes, and OS internals.

- **C++/**  
  C++ mini-projects related to secure coding. Includes:
  - VTable hijacking simulation
  - Object-oriented programming principles
  - Defensive techniques against memory corruption and code injection  

- **Java/**  
  Applications built with Java, including:
  - GUI-based games (Hangman, Mastermind, Game of Life)
  - Multithreaded banking system
  - Calendar app using priority queues and data structures  
  These projects reflect experience with Java OOP, GUI (Swing), and concurrent programming.

- **Python/**  
  Advanced scripting and metaprogramming using Python. Covers:
  - Custom class creation at runtime
  - Decorators and introspection
  - Dynamic code manipulation

- **SQL/**  
  Work from the database systems course, including:
  - Complex SQL queries
  - Handling XML and JSON in SQL contexts
  - Relational schema design and optimization

- **Security/**  
  Projects and seminar papers related to cybersecurity:
  - Code injection detection using machine learning
  - Cryptography exercises (encryption, secure protocols)
  - Workshop deliverables involving secure file sharing and vulnerability analysis
